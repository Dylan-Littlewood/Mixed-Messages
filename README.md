## Mixed Messages

### Overview

For this project, I will be building a message generator program.  
Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output.

### Topic

The topic for this project will be a project idea generator.  
this will take three different ideas to make a project with.  
 ***Optional*** - Add a programing language to the generator to try the project in.

### Actions

* [x] **Topic:** *Come up which types of messages will be used for output.*
